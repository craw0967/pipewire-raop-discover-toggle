# pipewire-raop-discover-toggle
Simple Gnome-Shell extension to load and unload the 'module-raop-discover' Pipewire module to toggle Airplay speaker connectivity.

This extension is not feature complete and will not update if another process enables or disables the module. Pipewire and pipewire-zeroconf are required packages. Pulseaudio is not supported outside of Pipewire.

This extension does not work with Gnome Shell 45 or later and is no longer being maintained. [Check out the new version here](https://github.com/craw0967/pipewire-airplay-toggle)
